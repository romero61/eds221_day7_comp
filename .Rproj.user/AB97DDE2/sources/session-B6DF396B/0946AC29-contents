# Joins

```{r}
animals <- tibble::tribble(
  ~location,   ~species,  ~maturity,
   "lagoon",   "bobcat",    "adult",
    "bluff",   "coyote", "juvenile",
    "creek",      "fox",    "adult",
     "oaks", "squirrel", "juvenile",
    "bluff",   "bobcat",    "adult"
  )

```


```{r}
sites <- tibble::tribble(
  ~location,      ~full_site_name, ~jurisdiction,
   "beach",       "Goleta Beach",     "SB City",

## Full Join

```{r}
full_join_example <- full_join(animals, sites)
# KEY --> by "x" = "y" 
```

## Left Join
```{r}
left_join_example <- left_join(animals, sites, by = "location")

left_join_example
```


## Inner Join

```{r}
inner_join_example <- inner_join(animals,sites, by = 'location')
inner_join_example
```
```{r}

sites_2 <- sites |> 
  rename((loc = location))

sites_2
```


## Semi Join
```{r}
semi_join_example <- semi_join(animals, sites, by = 'location')

semi_join_example
```

## Anti Join

```{r}
anti_join_example <- anti_join(animals, sites, by = "location")
anti_join_example
```

Refresher 1: Starting with the penguins dataset in the palmerpenguins package, write a single piped sequence in which you:

Only include penguins at Biscoe and Dream islands
Remove the year and sex variables
Add a new column called body_mass_kg, with penguin mass converted from grams to kilograms
Rename the island variable to location

```{r}
refresher1 <- penguins |> 
  filter(island == c("Biscoe", "Dream islands")) |> 
  select(-year, -sex) |> 
  mutate(body_mass_kg = body_mass_g /1000) |> 
  rename(location = island)

names(refresher1)
head(refresher1)
```



Refresher 2: Staring with the penguins dataset in the palmerpenguins package, write a single piped sequence in which you:

Limit to only Adelie penguins
Remove any observations where flipper_length_mm is NA (hint: !is.na())
Group the data by sex
Find the mean (mean()), standard deviation (sd) and sample size (n) of flipper_length_mm for male and female Adelie penguins, returned in a nice summary table
